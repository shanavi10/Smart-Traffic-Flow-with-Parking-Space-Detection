# Smart-Traffic-Flow-with-Parking-Space-Detection
Built an integrated Smart Traffic Flow and Parking Detection system using computer vision and IoT concepts. Implemented a real-time traffic simulation with dynamic signal control and an ambulance-priority mode that instantly switches signals to green. Developed an automated parking entry/exit workflow with camera-based number plate recognition, vehicle type detection, time logging, and parking fee computation. Included cloud data storage and a live dashboard for monitoring.
